# About
This is a simple site that display the weather and a map according to the user location.  
It was used two different API's, the first one was [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) to get information about the weather,and the second one was [Maps JavaScript API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/overview) to display a map on the site.  

*api keys doesn't work anymore  
OBS: if you receive the error message number 2 (possible firefox error),you can try to work around following these steps:  
1 - open new tab;  
2 - go to about:config;  
3 - search for geo.wifi.uri;  
4 - create a new string with value https://location.services.mozilla.com/v1/geolocate?key=test.
